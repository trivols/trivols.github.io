## About the team

Since 2006, the TriVols have been a training ground for triathletes to compete at the Collegiate level in the [Southeast](http://sectc.org) and against the top teams in the nation at Collegiate Nationals. More than just competition, the TriVols offer a fun and inclusive atmosphere for students at the University of Tennessee to train, as well as be involved in the triathlon community in East Tennessee.

Hey there, I’m Alex and I’m a third year PhD Student, doing research at Oak Ridge National Lab. Having competed with the University of Virginia in triathlon, I am beginning my 7th year training for triathlons. As President this year, I look to strengthen the core triathlon team at competition while growing the team at large through a variety of partnerships with the local community. Interested in the team?

How’s it going?  I’m Jake, a fifth year PhD student (not a kangaroo) and avid swimmer who got into triathlon four years ago when I came to UT.  I’m also a member of the local Provision Health and Performance Racing Team.  As Vice President, I’ll be acting in a support capacity to Alex while we work towards making the team bigger and better than ever.  I’m excited to see what our team can become over the next year and look forward to working with everyone on the team towards these goals.  Any questions about the team, triathlon, etc.?
