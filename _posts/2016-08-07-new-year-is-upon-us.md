It's almost that time again. Another year is upon us, the 11th season of the TriVols! It's been a fun, fun summer for those of us around Knoxville and we're excited to get the season rolling, albeit we'd like a little bit more of summer break as well.

One of the biggest changes, is this site you are reading from. The time has come to get back to a full, maintainable website to offer resources for you, the reader. Whether you're on the team now, thinking about joining the team (you really should), an alum, or love the TriVols (we love you too), we hope for this to be a good source for:

  * information about the team    
  * debriefs after events, races
  * schedules
  * resources to get into triathlon training
  * resources around the Knoxville area for training

As we look to grow our team, we are always looking for new sponsors to help support our members for races. In the coming weeks, look for a sponsorship packet to come out with all of the details that we can provide for your company. In the meantime, contact our [President]({{site.author.email  | prepend: 'mailto:'}}) for sponsorship inquiries!
